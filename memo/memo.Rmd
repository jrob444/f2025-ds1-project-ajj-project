This document should contain a detailed account of the data clean up for your data and the design choices you are making for your plots. For instance you will want to document choices you've made that were intentional for your graphic, e.g. color you've chosen for the plot. Think of this document as a code script someone can follow to reproduce the data cleaning steps and graphics in your handout.

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(gganimate)
library(scales)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
library(gifski)
```

## Data Clean Up Steps for Overall Data

### Step 1: Load and Inspect Dataset

```{r load-data, message = FALSE}
GDP_Data <- read_excel("/cloud/project/data/Annual_GDP_Growth_OECD_and_non_OECD.xlsx")
# View(Annual_GDP_Growth_OECD_and_non_OECD)

GDP_Per_Capita <- read_excel("/cloud/project/data/Annual GDP Per Capita OECD and Non-OECD.xlsx.xlsx")
# View(Annual_GDP_Per_Capita_OECD_and_Non_OECD_xlsx)
```

### Step 2: Rename Columns and Pivot Longer

```{r clean-columns-names, message = FALSE}
names(GDP_Per_Capita)[1] <- "Country"
```

```{r convert-to-long-format-for-time-series-analysis, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# make all column names characters  
names(GDP_Data) <-
  as.character(names(GDP_Data))

# convert all "year" columns (2018–2024) to characters before pivoting
GDP_Data <-
  GDP_Data %>%
  mutate(across(matches("^20"), as.character))

# pivot longer using the original "Time Period" column  
gdp_growth_long <- GDP_Data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = matches("^20"),       # selects 2018–2024 columns
    names_to = "Year",
    values_to = "GDP_Growth"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    Year = as.integer(Year),     # turn "2018" → 2018
     GDP_Growth = as.numeric(GDP_Growth),
    Country = `Time period`
  ) %>%
  select(-`Time period`)

gdp_growth_long <- gdp_growth_long %>%
  filter(Country != "Country")

GDP_Per_Capita <- GDP_Per_Capita %>%
  filter(str_trim(Country) != "Country") %>%
  select(-2)
```

Description:
The dataset originally had years (2018–2024) as columns, which makes it wide. pivot_longer() converts it into a tidy long format with Year and GDP_Growth columns, making it easier to plot over time.

### Step 3: Categorize Countries by Post Pandemic Growth 

```{r identify-countries-post-pandemic (2021-24), message = FALSE}
post_pandemic_growth <- gdp_growth_long %>%
  filter(Year >= 2021) %>%
  group_by(`Country`) %>%
  summarize(avg_growth_post_pandemic = mean(GDP_Growth, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_growth_post_pandemic))
```

Description:
 
### Step 4: Clean Non-OECD Countries from Filtered Data

```{r clean-non-OECD-country-name, message = FALSE}
gdp_growth_long <- gdp_growth_long %>%
  mutate(`Country` = str_replace(`Country`, pattern = "·  ", replacement = ""))

```


## Plots

```

#### Description:

This line plot tracks GDP growth for Denmark, India, South Africa, and the United States from 2018 to 2024, allowing for a comparison of economic performance before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The plot highlights the collapse in growth for all four countries in 2020, followed by their rebound in 2021 and the more moderate variations that follow through 2024.

The goal of this visualization is not only to measure post-COVID recovery but also to show the broader economic trajectory each country has taken across three phases: pre-pandemic stability, the sharp contraction in 2020, and the uneven recovery that followed. The four countries were chosen deliberately to represent different continents and to contrast two OECD members (Denmark and the United States) with two non-OECD economies (India and South Africa).

A few broader patterns stand out. India shows the most dramatic swings, with the steepest decline during the pandemic and the strongest rebound immediately afterward. This reflects a common pattern among fast-growing emerging economies, which tend to expand rapidly in good years but also contract more sharply during global shocks. In contrast, the United States and Denmark display more moderate movements around the baseline, characteristic of advanced economies with steadier long-term growth dynamics. South Africa sits between these extremes, with a slower recovery and more modest post-2021 growth.

Taken together, our plot shows how different country's economic structures shape their vulnerability and resilience. High-growth emerging economies like India experience far more volatility, while more advanced OECD economies drop and recover more gradually.

### Plot 2: Average GDP Growth by Category

  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)

ggsave("plot2_post_pandemic.png", plot = plot2_post_pandemic, width = 7, height = 5)
plot2_post_pandemic
```

#### Description:

This bar plot displays the top fifteen countries by average annual GDP growth over the period from 2021 to 2024. The values shown represent the mean growth rate across these four post-pandemic years. This helps smooth out year-to-year swings and gives a clearer sense of each country’s overall recovery strength.

India stands out clearly as the strongest performer in the dataset, with average annual growth close to 8 percent. Türkiye, Ireland, and China follow, each with averages near or slightly above 6 percent. The remaining countries decline gradually down the ranking, but all still exhibit relatively solid performance compared with the broader dataset. Because this plot only shows the fifteen best-performing nations, even the countries at the bottom of this list grew faster on average than roughly thirty other countries not included in the chart.

A broader pattern is visible as well. Many of the economies near the top of the ranking are either large emerging markets or countries that experienced strong post-COVID rebounds driven by domestic demand, targeted sector expansion, or favorable structural trends. Countries further down the list are often smaller advanced economies whose growth rates tend to be steadier and more moderate. Taken together, the plot highlights how uneven the post-pandemic recovery has been across the world, with some nations surging ahead while others regained momentum at a slower pace.

# Step 4: Save and display plot
ggsave("plot3_box.png", plot = plot3_box, width = 5, height = 4)
plot3_box
```

#### Description:

The boxplot compares GDP growth distributions for the two recovery categories, Booming and Recovering, over the period from 2021 to 2024. Most countries in the dataset fall into the Booming category, which shows that a large share of both OECD and non-OECD economies experienced average annual growth above 3 percent during the post-COVID recovery. The Recovering category has fewer countries and shows a noticeably lower median rate of growth. 

Initially, we wanted to add a category named "stagnating" but we decided against doing so, as no single country in our datasets had average growth in negative levels during the selected time period, which would have classified them as stagnating. 

The Booming group has a wider range of values and includes one clear outlier at the top, which represents Ireland’s unusually high post-pandemic growth. The Recovering group is more tightly clustered, with values concentrated closer to zero.

A broader pattern also emerges from the distribution. Many advanced economies, such as Germany, Austria, Finland, and the Netherlands, show slower growth and therefore appear more often in the Recovering category. This reflects typical features of mature, high-income economies, which tend to expand at a steadier and slower pace. In contrast, several emerging and developing economies in Asia and Africa experienced rapid post-COVID rebounds driven by rising domestic demand, expanding labor markets, and catch-up growth. These types of countries tend to be in the Booming category.

#### Description: 

The animated line plot illustrates how GDP growth evolved across world regions from 2018 to 2024, with a particular emphasis on the impact of the COVID-19 recession in 2020 and the recovery that followed. Each country in the dataset is shown as a faint grey line, allowing the broader regional distribution to remain visible in the background. Four countries: India, the United States, Denmark, and South Africa, are highlighted in distinct colors so their trajectories can be compared more easily.

As the animation progresses year by year, the viewer can follow how growth levels change over time. All countries move sharply downward in 2020, which is marked by a red-shaded band to visually identify the COVID downturn. After this low point, most economies rebound in 2021, but the extent of the recovery differs substantially. India stands out as the strongest performer, climbing dramatically above the others in the immediate post-Covid period. The remaining highlighted countries recover more moderately, with South Africa and Denmark following slower, flatter paths, and the United States sitting roughly between them. 

The outlier at the top of the plot, showing GDP growth above 16% in 2021, is Ireland. This unusually high figure reflects several structural factors in the way Ireland’s GDP is measured. Because many multinational corporations register their intellectual property and profits in Ireland, their global earnings are counted in Ireland’s national accounts even when most of the underlying economic activity takes place elsewhere. This accounting effect inflates headline GDP growth, making Ireland appear to grow far faster than the underlying domestic economy. As the de facto EU hub for many large global firms, Ireland’s GDP metrics are therefore highly sensitive to multinational profit flows rather than traditional economic output alone, which also is high at around 5% annually. 

Additionally, the noticeable uptick in Denmark’s 2024 growth reflects the extraordinary performance of its pharmaceutical sector, driven in particular by Novo Nordisk. Recent estimates indicate that the company alone contributed roughly half of Denmark’s total GDP growth during the last 2 years, amplifying the country’s post-pandemic recovery figures.

The animation helps reveal not just the magnitude of growth changes, but also the timing and steepness of each country’s trajectory. This dynamic presentation makes it easier to see how the shock of 2020 unfolded and how different economies diverged in the years that followed.

#### Description: 

This plot compares the average GDP per capita of 46 countries to their average annual GDP growth from 2021 to 2024. Each point represents one country, with colors distinguishing OECD members from non members. A clear pattern emerges across the scatter. Countries with higher GDP per capita, which are mostly OECD members, experienced noticeably weaker economic growth in the post COVID period. In comparison, lower income economies, which are mostly non OECD members, saw stronger and more rapid growth. The negative slope of the trendline displays this relationship.

India, the strongest performer in the plot, sits high on the plot with low GDP per capita but very fast growth. South Africa is placed lower, but still fits the pattern of non OECD economies growing more quickly than the wealthier OECD countries to the right. Denmark and the United States are located among the higher income cluster, where growth is solid but much slower than in emerging economies.

This plot helps show the broader post pandemic dynamic. Advanced economies recovered steadily but without dramatic acceleration, while several emerging economies grew rapidly as they caught up from earlier downturns and benefited from expanding domestic markets. The visualization highlights this contrast and provides a clear way to compare these economic trajectories across income levels.
